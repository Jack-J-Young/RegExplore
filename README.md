# RegExplore
This project explores a minimal instantiation of transformational creativity, using Regular Expressions (RegEx) as the central creative artefact. As such, each RegEx is seen to define a search space.
This work is built on the formalization developed by Garaint Wiggins, which is turn is based on the earlier work by Margaret Boden.
